# Week 03 — 2026

**Date**: January 13-19, 2026
**Month**: 2 (Sequence Models)
**Focus**: PyTorch Foundations

---

## Goals

What I plan to accomplish this week:

- [x] Set up sequence-models project with proper structure
- [ ] Master PyTorch tensors, autograd, and DataLoader
- [ ] Build and train feedforward classifier as baseline
- [ ] Prepare for RNN implementation next week

---

## Daily Log

### Monday (2 hrs)
- [x] Set up sequence-models project structure
- [x] PyTorch environment setup & verification
- [x] Tensors tutorial — creation, operations, GPU

**Notes**: Project scaffold created with pyproject.toml, src/, tests/. PyTorch 2.9.1 installed with MPS (Apple Silicon GPU) support. All 3 initial tests pass. Tensors notebook created covering creation, attributes, operations, reshaping, MPS acceleration (2.4x speedup), and autograd preview.

### Tuesday (2 hrs)
- [x] Autograd deep dive — gradients, backward pass
- [x] Build simple feedforward network

**Notes**: Covered computation graphs, backward(), gradient accumulation, no_grad(), and built a complete training loop that learns y=2x+1. Built FeedforwardClassifier with nn.Module, trained on moons dataset (89.5% accuracy), created reusable module with 5 tests.

### Wednesday (2.5 hrs)
- [ ] Dataset and DataLoader patterns
- [ ] Load IMDB sentiment dataset
- [ ] Write data preprocessing module

**Notes**:

### Thursday (2 hrs)
- [ ] Complete training loop implementation
- [ ] Add validation loop

**Notes**:

### Friday (2 hrs)
- [ ] Write tests for data loading and model
- [ ] Create Jupyter notebook documenting learnings

**Notes**:

### Weekend (4.5 hrs)
- [ ] Build simple neural network classifier
- [ ] Train on IMDB with proper logging
- [ ] Weekly retro & tracker update
- [ ] Research RNN architecture for next week
