# Week 2 — 2026

**Date**: January 10-16, 2026
**Month**: 1 — NLP Foundations
**Focus**: Text Preprocessing with NLTK

---

## Goals

What I plan to accomplish this week:

- [ ] Set up project structure with pyproject.toml
- [ ] Implement tokenization (word + sentence level)
- [ ] Add text normalization (stopwords, stemming, lemmatization)
- [ ] Write tests for core functionality
- [ ] Create initial README with usage examples

---

## Daily Log

### Day 1-2: Project Setup & Tokenization (5 hrs)
- [ ] Create project structure with `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Set up NLTK and download required corpora
- [ ] Implement basic tokenization (word, sentence)
- [ ] Add configurable tokenization strategies
- [ ] Write initial tests for tokenization

**Notes**:

### Day 3-4: Text Normalization (5 hrs)
- [ ] Implement stopword removal
- [ ] Add stemming (Porter, Snowball)
- [ ] Add lemmatization with NLTK WordNet
- [ ] Create unified preprocessing pipeline class

**Notes**:

### Day 5-6: Testing & Polish (4 hrs)
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all components
- [ ] Handle edge cases (empty strings, unicode, special chars)
- [ ] Add CLI or script entry point
- [ ] Write initial README with usage examples

**Notes**:

### Day 7: Reflection & Prep (1 hr)
- [ ] Run `/retro` for Week 1 reflection
- [ ] Log progress to memory
- [ ] Preview Week 2 (embeddings)
