# Technology Tiers

Overview of the tier system for the AI Practitioner Booster 2026.

---

## Tier Philosophy

The curriculum is organized into three tiers based on complexity and prerequisites:

| Tier | Focus | Scope |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Tier 1** | Foundation | Core skills every AI practitioner needs |
| **Tier 2** | Shipping | Production skills for deploying AI systems |
| **Tier 3** | Scale | Advanced infrastructure and optimization |

---

## Pace by Level

Learner levels determine which tiers you cover in 2026:

| Level | Tiers | Scope |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Beginner** | Tier 1 only | Foundation (53 items) |
| **Intermediate** | Tier 1 + Tier 2 | Foundation + Shipping (148 items) |
| **Advanced** | Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 | All tiers (175 items) |

Your level: **Advanced** — You'll cover all three tiers.

## Your Custom Stack

You've selected specific technologies from your custom stack (MY_STACK.md).

The curriculum prioritizes your checked items while maintaining tier scope:

- **Tier 1 selections**: RNN, LSTM, Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, YOLO, Bash, GraphQL, Flask, Django, NLTK, Dash, Metabase
- **Tier 2 selections**: MLOps, DevOps, CI/CD, RAG Systems, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, Vector DBs, and many more
- **Tier 3 selections**: MCP, A2A, Kafka, Spark, Kubernetes (production), CUDA, Federated Learning, and more

## Curriculum Integration

Each month's curriculum draws from appropriate tiers:

| Month | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1-3 | Heavy | Light | - |
| 4-6 | Medium | Heavy | Light |
| 7-9 | Light | Heavy | Medium |
| 10-12 | Light | Medium | Heavy |

This progression ensures foundations are solid before tackling advanced topics.

## Tier Progression Rules

### Prerequisites

- Tier 2 assumes Tier 1 foundations
- Tier 3 assumes Tier 2 proficiency

### Adaptations

When adapting your path:
- Remediation focuses on current tier scope
- Level changes add/remove tier scope
- Project swaps stay within tier scope

### Overlap

Some topics span tiers:
- "Kubernetes (intro)" in Tier 2
- "Kubernetes (platform-grade)" in Tier 3

The curriculum differentiates depth appropriately.
