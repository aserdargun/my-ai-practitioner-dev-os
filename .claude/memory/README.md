# Memory System

This folder contains the learning state for your AI Practitioner Booster 2026 journey. These files are the **source of truth** for your progress, decisions, and insights.

## Overview

The memory system consists of:

| File | Purpose | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| [learner_profile.json](learner_profile.json) | Your goals, constraints, schedule | JSON |
| [progress_log.jsonl](progress_log.jsonl) | Timestamped events | JSON Lines |
| [decisions.jsonl](decisions.jsonl) | Important decisions | JSON Lines |
| [best_practices.md](best_practices.md) | Living doc of learnings | Markdown |

## Key Principles

### Append-Only

Memory files are **append-only** sources of truth:
- Never delete entries from progress_log.jsonl or decisions.jsonl
- Only add new entries
- The full history is preserved for analysis

### Human Oversight

Claude must show proposed memory updates to you and receive explicit approval before writing to any memory file:

1. Claude proposes an update
2. You review the proposed content
3. You approve or modify
4. Only then is the content written

### Derived vs. Source

- **Source of truth**: Memory files (`.claude/memory/*`)
- **Derived artifact**: `paths/Advanced/tracker.md`

The tracker may be regenerated by `report.py` based on memory files. If there's a conflict, memory files are authoritative.

## File Formats

### learner_profile.json

```json
{
  "level": "Advanced",
  "goals": [
    "Master ML engineering end-to-end",
    "Build production RAG systems",
    "Learn Kubernetes and cloud deployment"
  ],
  "constraints": {
    "hours_per_week": 15,
    "preferred_times": ["evenings", "weekends"],
    "learning_style": "hands-on projects"
  },
  "schedule": {
    "start_date": "2026-01-01",
    "current_month": 1,
    "current_week": 1
  }
}
```

### progress_log.jsonl

Each line is a JSON object with:

```json
{"timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z", "event": "week_start", "week": 3, "month": 1}
{"timestamp": "2026-01-19T17:00:00Z", "event": "week_complete", "week": 3, "status": "partial", "highlight": "Completed EDA notebook"}
{"timestamp": "2026-01-20T09:00:00Z", "event": "deliverable_shipped", "name": "baseline_model", "month": 1}
```

Event types:
- `week_start` — New week begins
- `week_complete` — Week retrospective done
- `deliverable_shipped` — Project milestone completed
- `blocker_identified` — Learning block encountered
- `blocker_resolved` — Block overcome
- `path_change` — Adaptation applied

### decisions.jsonl

Important decisions with rationale:

```json
{"timestamp": "2026-02-01T10:00:00Z", "decision": "skip_remediation", "rationale": "Score 7.5/10 sufficient to proceed", "approved_by": "user"}
{"timestamp": "2026-03-15T14:00:00Z", "decision": "project_swap", "from": "time_series_forecaster", "to": "demand_predictor", "rationale": "Better alignment with job goals"}
```

### best_practices.md

Free-form markdown with dated entries:

```markdown
# Best Practices

## 2026-01-20 — Focus Management

Taking 5-minute breaks every 45 minutes helps maintain focus during long coding sessions.

## 2026-02-05 — Debugging Embeddings

When debugging embedding issues, always check input encoding first. Saved 2 hours by catching UTF-8 issues early.
```

## Usage

### Reading Memory

Claude reads memory to provide context-aware suggestions:

```python
import json

# Read profile
with open('.claude/memory/learner_profile.json') as f:
    profile = json.load(f)

# Read progress log
events = []
with open('.claude/memory/progress_log.jsonl') as f:
    for line in f:
        events.append(json.loads(line))
```

### Proposing Updates

When Claude wants to update memory:

1. Claude generates the proposed entry
2. Shows it to you for review
3. You approve or modify
4. Entry is appended

Example interaction:
```
Claude: I'd like to log this week's completion. Here's the proposed entry:

{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-26T17:00:00Z",
  "event": "week_complete",
  "week": 4,
  "status": "complete",
  "highlight": "Shipped baseline model with 85% accuracy"
}

Approve this entry?
```

### Manual Editing

You have full control over memory files. You can:
- Edit learner_profile.json directly
- Add entries to progress_log.jsonl
- Update best_practices.md anytime
- Review and correct any entries

## Integration

### With Path Engine

- `evaluate.py` reads memory to compute scores
- `adapt.py` reads memory to propose adaptations
- `report.py` reads memory to generate tracker

### With Commands

- `/status` reads progress_log for current state
- `/evaluate` analyzes progress_log patterns
- `/add-best-practice` appends to best_practices.md
- `/retro` logs week_complete events
